== Map Support

SmallRye Config allows injecting multiple configuration parameters as a `Map` using the standard annotations (`@ConfigProperty` and `@ConfigProperties`) which can
be very helpful especially with a dynamic configuration.

For example, let's say that I want to keep in my configuration the custom reason phrases to return to the end user according to the http status code.
In that particular use case, the configuration could then be something like the following properties file:

[source,properties]
----
server.reasons.200=My custom reason phrase for OK
server.reasons.201=My custom reason phrase for Created
...
----

The previous configuration could be injected directly into your bean using the standard annotations as next:

With `@ConfigProperty`

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class ConfigBean {

    @Inject
    @ConfigProperty(name = "server.reasons", defaultValue = "200=OK;201=Created") <1>
    Map<Integer, String> reasons; <2>

}
----
<1> Provide the name of the parent configuration property from the annotation `@ConfigProperty`. Provide also the default values to use in case no direct sub properties could be found, using the syntax `<key1>=<value1>;<key2>=<value2>...`, so here the default values are "OK" for 200 and "Created" for 201.
<2> Provide the expected type of `Map`, here the keys will automatically be converted into Integers, and the values into Strings.

With `@ConfigProperties`

[source,java]
----
@ConfigProperties(prefix = "server") <1>
public class Config {

    Map<Integer, String> reasons; <2>
}
----
<1> Provide the prefix of the name of the parent configuration property from the annotation `@ConfigProperties`, here the prefix is `server`.
<2> Provide the suffix of the name of the parent configuration, and the expected type of `Map`, here the keys will automatically be converted into Integers, and the values into Strings.

NOTE: Only the direct sub properties will be converted into a `Map` and injected into the target bean, the rest will be ignored. In other words, in the previous example, a property whose name is `reasons.200.a` would be ignored as not considered as a direct sub property.

NOTE: The property will be considered as missing if no direct sub properties could be found.

It is also possible to do the exact same thing programmatically by calling the non-standard method `SmallRyeConfig#getValues("server.reasons", Integer.class, String.class)` if the property is mandatory otherwise by calling the method `SmallRyeConfig#getOptionalValues("server.reasons", Integer.class, String.class)`.
