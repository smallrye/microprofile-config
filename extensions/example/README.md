# Example Application

This is a very basic example application to demonstrate the Config extensions.

## Running the example.

Using maven, you can start this application using Thorntail, Payara or OpenLiberty:

    
```
    mvn -Pthorntail clean install
```
or
```
    mvn -Ppayara clean install
```
or
```
    mvn -Popenliberty clean install
```

You can then go to http://localhost:8080/config-example/api/openapi-ui
