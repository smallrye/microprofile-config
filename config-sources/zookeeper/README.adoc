= ZooKeeper ConfigSource

Implementation of a https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/configsources.asciidoc[MicroProfile ConfigSource] that is backed by Apache Zookeeper.

Using the MicroProfile Configuration API is a really convenient way to configure your application.
The standard MicroProfile Confiration Sources are Environment Variables, System Variables and via a microprofile-config.properties file in the Classpath.
This project enables MicroProfile Configurations to be obtained from Apache Zookeeper.
The benefits are that configurations can be shared across applications and a future version will allow applications to subscribe to updates to the configuration parameters.

== Usage

To use the Zookeeper ConfigSource build this project, add the following to your Maven `pom.xml`

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.smallrye</groupId>
    <artifactId>zookeeper-config-source</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

You will need to boostrap your application with the location of your Zookeeper server and a unique identifier for your applciation.
Add the following to `src/main/resources/META-INF/mircoprofile-config.properties` or create equivalent Environment Variables.

```bash
io.smallrye.configsource.zookeeper.url=localhost:2181
io.smallrye.configsource.zookeeper.applicationId=com.example.my-application
```

Following this any properties that are looked up via the Config API or Injected will be looked up in Zookeeper in addition to the standard MicroProfile Config locations.
The `ZKMicroProfileConfigSource` has a lower Ordinal than the standard locations and thus *will not* override property files or Environment Variables.

The ConfigSource will store the following znodes in the specified Zookeeper server `/applicationId/propertyName = value`.

The snippet below shows how to parameterise your application with either injected values or looking them up using a ConfigProvider

```java
@Inject
@ConfigProperty(name = "propertyName", defaultValue = "default_value")
String strProp;

//Or

final Config cfg = ConfigProvider.getConfig();
final String strProp = cfg.getValue("propertyName", String.class);
```

== Example

An example of how to use the Config Source is supplied in the Example directory:
